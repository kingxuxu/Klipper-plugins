# Rainbow Barf Logo LED for StealthBurner

Ok, sure, it's pretty cool to have the Voron logo on the StealthBurner light up. And, yeah, it's even cooler to have it change colors. But wouldn't it be *even cooler still* to have it do *this*?

The Rainbow Barf Logo LED is a small PCB, approximately the size of a typical single 5050 WS2812 "Neopixel" PCB, but holding *eight* miniature protocol-compatible LEDs positioned to match the logo cutout on the StealthBurner.

This gives you the possibility to programmatically address each part of the logo lighting independently! Imagine the possibilities!
